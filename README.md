# java-set

This repository contains Java implementations of Set data structures using arrays and ArrayLists. Sets are fundamental data structures that store unique elements, ensuring that no duplicates are present.

## Files

- `SetByArray.java`: Implementation of a Set using an array-based approach.
- `SetByArrayList.java`: Implementation of a Set using an ArrayList-based approach.

## Usage

To use these implementations, simply include the corresponding Java file in your project and instantiate the Set object as needed. Both implementations provide standard Set operations such as adding elements, removing elements, checking for containment, and retrieving the size of the Set.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
